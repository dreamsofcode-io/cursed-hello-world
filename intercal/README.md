# Intercal

Intercal requires the use of the intercal compiler, also known as `ick`.

With `ick` installed, you then need to compile the code using it.

```
$ ick hello.i
```

If everything works correctly, this should produce a binary called `hello`, which you can run using:

```
./hello.i
```

## Tools

Inside the tools directory is a python script called print.py.
Using this script, you can derive the values you need for printing an array
to stdout. Just change the input the to `figureout` function and then
use the output as the values for your INTERCAL array.
