# Whitespace

In order to run whitespace space, you first need a whitespace interpreter.
There are [many](https://github.com/wspace/corpus) you can choose from,
but the one I went with was [zorchenhimer/whitespace](https://github.com/zorchenhimer/whitespace/tree/1a0ed1aca43229dd9d8cb126a427aa3e7bef94af).
If you do the same, then you'll want to use the `wi` binary.

```
./wi hello.ws
```
